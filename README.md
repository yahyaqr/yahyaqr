# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

First and foremost, I love graphic design :paintbrush:, writing code :computer:, and educating people :man_teacher:.

I'm not good at aesthetics, but I understand design systems and design principles well.

## Frontend Development
I found my love for frontend development because frontend developers combine graphic design and programming skills to help users better understand how to use an application. I enjoy testing and implementing user interface designs repeatedly to determine the best design composition. I also find enjoyment when my products have been launched and used by many people.
